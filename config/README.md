# WSAF Website Configuration

This folder contains configuration files for the WSAF website - you should be able to change most aspects of the
website from here alone, without needing to delve too much into the main codebase.

Note that updating the FAQ still needs to be done within the main codebase, in `src/app/(home)/components/faq/tabs`.
This should hopefully still be relatively straightforward to do.
