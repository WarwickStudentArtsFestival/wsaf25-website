          <h3>Why are you putting on this event?</h3>
          <p>
            The University of Warwick has a wealth of highly motivated student
            bands, theatre societies and other performing groups which we want
            to present to whole University community in the summer term. This is
            inspired by the old &apos;Warwick Student Arts Festival&apos;, which
            to our knowledge last took place in 2015.

            WSAF&apos;s aim is to widen performance opportunities and to give
            people the chance to watch something that they might not have seen
            otherwise. We&apos;re providing a wider range of arts than
            society-specific events such as StageFest and Freshblood, and are
            more performance and arts-related than SocsFest. You&apos;re more
            than welcome to submit and exhibit the same performance at both WSAF
            and another event.
