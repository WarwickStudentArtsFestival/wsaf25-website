            The Warwick Student Arts Festival came back to campus for the second
            year on 13th-16th June 2025, featuring 165 events across 10 venues
            and welcoming over 8000 attendees. In addition to continuing on the
            success of the previous year, WSAF 2025 introduced a fully
            student-run outdoor bar and partnered with Music Theatre
            Warwick&apos;s Stagefest and Warwick BandSoc&apos;s WickFest to form
            an even bigger celebration of student creativity.

            Not only did WSAF 2025 give 300+ students the opportunity to
            showcase their talents, but in a post-event survey, over 50% of
            respondents said that WSAF encouraged them to see something they
            usually wouldn&apos;t see, with 30% of respondents not normally
            attending live arts events or performances at all. Overall, we
            received an average rating of 9/10, with everyone saying they would
            be likely to recommend the festival to their friends and attend the
            festival again.

            Thank you to everyone who attended, took part in, or organised
            Warwick Student Arts Festival 2025. Our core goal is to celebrate
            student creativity at the University of Warwick, and we
            couldn&apos;t have achieved that without the countless hours of
            organisation, practise and teamwork going on in the months, weeks
            and days leading up to the festival.
          </p>
